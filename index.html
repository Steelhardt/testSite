        <h2>What Did I learn?</h2>
        <p>
          I learned that creating objects in a scene with 3js is easy to do.
          Although creating animations like the scrolling effect you see now was
          challenging to understand.
        </p>
        <h2>So how do you make the scrolling animation?</h2>
        <p>
          In order to create the scroll animation you need to go into styles.css
          and make
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>main{position:absolute //to make it not move//</li>
          <li>display: grid; //this is to create sections with scrolling</li>

          <li>
            grid-template-columns: repeat(12, 1fr); /*to make 12 even columns
            that we can access*/
          </li>
          <li>
            For example in styles.css header { background: var(--dark-bg);
            grid-column: 2 / span 5; /*START on col 2 span 5 columns*/}y
          </li>
        </ul>
